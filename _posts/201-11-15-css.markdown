**What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
  Compare to regular CSS**


I would say that pre-compiling CSS is actually easier than writing  pure CSS. Mostly because you don't have to write the same code
over and over… It also lets you use some variables and other helpful things such as selector nestling. It makes CSS closer to “real” programming.

  **Which techniques did you use?**

I have used SASS.

**Pros and cons?**

The pros is that you don't have to repeat yourself so much. This tanks to the fact that it makes CSS closer to real programing with; functions for transformation, selector nestling, the use of variables and mix-ins. The biggest cons is that it's a bit harder to debug if something goes wrong
since the css lines don't match those that you have written in your precompiled css.

  **What do you think of static site generators?**

I think that it's an awesome way to build a website! Even tho i have had some problems getting into it i can alredy see the huge benefits of it.
It's a simple and fast way to get a quite advanced site!

 **What type of projects are they suitable for?**

They are perfect for smaller  sites, such as blogs.


  **What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**

Robots.txt is a txt file that give instructions and information about your site to
webb robots (such as search engines and more). For this site i've blocked my include files and my layout files, but opened the rest.


  **What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**

Humans.txt is a file on your site that presents who and how the site was made. On this sites humans.txt you can read that i have created it and
abit about the software i have used to build my site.


  **How did you implements comments to blog posts**

I have used disqus for comments on my site.


  **What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?**

Open Graph is a protocol that lets you decide how you want your site to be presented if it's linked, liked, or shared on social media.
