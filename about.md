**Hello and welcome!**


My name is Alexander Nilsson, although nobody ever calls me Alexander, everyone who knows me calls me Alle! :)


I'm a 25 year old chap from Öland, Sweden. For those of you who know Öland i live outside a little village called karum, which is about
in the middle of the middle of Öland!
At the moment my family is made up of me, my beautiful, kind, and in all ways fantastic girlfriend Saga, and our two dogs!
We have one nine years old german shepherd, called Homer, he got that name because his life is full of "DOH" moments..... And our little chihuahua
mix breed, Skilla, she is 5 months now, and our little baby!

At karum we have a small horse farm with room for 9 horses (although we only have 4 atm). I have lived here for close to 6 years now
and i love this place. It might be in the middle of nowhere, but that suites me pretty good, i love the calmness and the stillness you
get on the countryside, it's like blam for your soul, i've never been much of a city person....


The horses is both one of my interests and one of my jobs. I started to ride when i was very little, my mom was a riding teacher so i spent
most of my time growing up in or in close proximity to some or another stable.... At first i wasn't really that interested tho, i had more fun
running around doing stupid shit and just playing about. But somewhere in my early teens i started to spend more and more time on the back
of a horse. By the time i was twenty i more or less work full time with horses. Back then i bought and sold a lot of horses, did some
breaking in of youngsters, a little of that and some of this more or less.... At that time i had around 10 horses to tend for, and to ride and it was
more or less all i did.


After a few years of that i started to grew a bit sick of it, it's just too much work for too little gain, i still ride a bit tho, and i still break in a few
(maybe 3-10) youngsters a year, and i try to have at least one horse in training all the time, be it my own or someone else's... Just to don't
forget all that i have learned thru the years...


The last few year my main occupation has been my small company, where i do more or less everything. Quite a lot of carpeting, some painting,
i take care of a Södras spruce cone plantation in bredsättra, and alot more... If someone need help fixing something, i'll fix it ;)


One of the reason i feel away from riding and competing horses was that i fell in love with Muay Thai. I started to train Muay Thai a few years ago
back at Apex Kalmar, a great gym in Kalmar, we are one big happy family! Training Muay thai made me want to go to Thailand, to experience the
the sport the way it's supposed to be experienced... But that's quite hard to do when you have a stable full of horses, so i sold them and went to
Thailand! I've been there two winters now, fought 9 bouts (won 8!). I even had the great opportunity to fight at Lumpinee Stadium, in Bangkok
the Albert hall of Muay Thai! I lost that fight tho, got knocked in the first round! But it was a fantastic experience!
After that i started to get abit bored of Muay Thai… I guess that's how i work, i find something i love doing and do it 120% until i feel i have accomplished what i wanted to then i move on to the next thing...


Right now, i spend most of my time studying, i made a full turn about and started to study Web Development, something we always want to
learn but never gotten into, until now! And i must say that i love it, even if it's faaaaar more time consuming than i thought!
My respect for programmers and their likes has grown a lot, there is so much you need to know! But i'll just but my nose to the grinder and work
on, and hopefully, in a few years, i can do all the cool stuff!


Besides my studies and my horses i have also started to build a little house on the farm, which takes up quite a lot of my time.


Sorry for the long introduction... XD thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!
